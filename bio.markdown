Ryan Carmelo Briones works for Edgecase, LLC in Columbus, OH where he has been christened as Server Monkey/Code Samurai which is just a fancy way of saying he has rare love for both servers and code. A product of the "Internet Age", Ryan has spent much of the last 10 years “poking” at the HTTP in as many ways possible working for the likes of Internet Services Providers, Non-Profit Organizations and Web Startups. These days you're likely find Ryan advocating for the Ruby programming language, software craftsmanship through the practice of pragmatism and the consumption of slow-smoked, barbecued meats.
